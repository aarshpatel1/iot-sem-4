### **3. What is file Handling Modes in Python? Explain Different File Handling Modes.**

- **File Handling:**  
  Python provides built-in functions to open, read, write, and close files using different modes.

- **File Handling Modes:**
  - **'r' (Read):** Opens a file for reading. Error if file doesn't exist.
  - **'w' (Write):** Opens a file for writing. Creates new or overwrites existing file.
  - **'a' (Append):** Opens a file for appending data at the end. Creates file if it doesn't exist.
  - **'r+' (Read and Write):** Opens a file for both reading and writing.
  - **'w+' (Write and Read):** Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites file.
  - **'a+' (Append and Read):** Opens for both appending and reading.
  - **'b' (Binary):** Used to handle binary files (add to other modes like 'rb', 'wb').
  - **'t' (Text):** Default mode. Used for text files.
