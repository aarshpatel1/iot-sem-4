## Answer the long questions:

### **1. Explain the working principles of different types of sensors used in IoT applications**

#### a. **Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11, LM35):**

- Measures ambient temperature.
- Works by changing electrical resistance or voltage according to the temperature.
- The microcontroller reads the voltage/resistance to calculate temperature.

#### b. **Humidity Sensor:**

- Measures moisture in the air.
- Uses capacitive or resistive sensing elements.
- Output changes with the change in moisture levels.

#### c. **PIR Motion Sensor:**

- Detects infrared radiation emitted by humans/animals.
- When motion is detected, it sends a high signal to the controller.

#### d. **Ultrasonic Sensor:**

- Measures distance using sound waves.
- Sends an ultrasonic wave and measures the time taken for the echo to return.

#### e. **Light Sensor (LDR):**

- Detects light intensity.
- Resistance decreases with increasing light intensity.
